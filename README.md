# Big Data Multi-Query Optimizer
==============================================
The MOTH System
==============================================
Multi-Query Optimization using Tuple Size and Histogram (MOTH) system has been proposed to consider the granularity of the reused-based opportunities. The proposed MOTH system exploits the coarse-grained of the fully and partially reused-based opportunities among queries with considering non-equal tuples size and non-uniform data distribution to avoid repeated computations.  The publications are available at

The JAS-MOTH System
==============================================
Join Aggregation Sort-MOTH system (JAS-MOTH) is an extension of MOTH system to exploit sharing work among multi-query.
